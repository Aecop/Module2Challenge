# Module2Challenge


## Project Description
This project is to complete Module 2 Challenge. It shows basic skill of CSS and HTML of what I have learned in the course through 2 weeks and created basic portfolio.
I have used CSS and HTML only to create this website. 

Language: HTML, CSS

Once I get more practice and more knowledge, I would love to take more of my knowledge to create a beautiful portfolio to use for interview and professional career in the future. 

Unfortuntely I was not able to perfect this challenge. With the time of submission, was not able to finish the module.
